    <h1>Salty's</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Salty's, home of the Salty Delight Burger!<br>Founded in 1984 by Simon S. Salty. A resturant dedicated
        to the ultimate goal of serving the very best cheap and super fast food. Unfortunately, due to recent FDA health
        code violations, our original location was deemed too "harzardous" for operation. You can find our "all new and
        improved"
        location at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/btxc7BCevENHwRuq7" target="_blank">336 Sumner St, East Boston</a> ,
        02128. To place an order for pickup or delivery please call (+1)738-808-2187.</p>
